I'm a [trainer and coach at Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com/people/jon/), and
the author of _[iOS Unit Testing by Example: XCTest Tips and Techniques Using Swift](https://pragprog.com/titles/jrlegios/)_.
I've been practicing test-driven development (TDD) on Apple platforms for over 20 years.
My website [Quality Coding](https://qualitycoding.org) focuses on technical agile practices for iOS developers, including unit testing, TDD, and refactoring.
