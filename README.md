I'm a technical lean/agile coach at [Industrial Logic](https://www.industriallogic.com), and
the author of _[iOS Unit Testing by Example: XCTest Tips and Techniques Using Swift](https://pragprog.com/titles/jrlegios/)_.
I've been practicing test-driven development (TDD) on Apple platforms for 20 years.
My website [Quality Coding](https://qualitycoding.org) focuses on technical agile practices for iOS developers. These include unit testing, TDD, and refactoring.
