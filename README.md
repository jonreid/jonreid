I'm the author of _[iOS Unit Testing by Example: XCTest Tips and Techniques Using Swift](https://pragprog.com/titles/jrlegios/)_.
I've been practicing test-driven development (TDD) on Apple platforms for 20 years.
My consultancy [Quality Coding, Inc.](https://qualitycoding.org) offers training for iOS teams in technical agile practices. These include unit testing, TDD, and refactoring.
